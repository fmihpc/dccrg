Make dccrg even more modular:
-separate stateless logic (doesn't consider whether cells exist or not)
 into dccrg_index.hpp or similar with function names starting with get_.
-separate serial stateful logic into a separate file with function names
 starting with find_.
-separate parallel logic into a separate file.
-only put logic related to cell data into dccrg.hpp.
