dccrg is a header only library so installation consists of
putting the .hpp files in this directory somewhere where
your compiler can find them.

dccrg requires MPI-2, boost and Zoltan which might be
available from your distribution. If not you can compile
them for example into your home directory. Installation
instructions for several machines / systems are given in
https://github.com/fmihpc/dccrg/wiki/Install
With small modifications dccrg can also work with MPI-1,
namely a few MPI-2 functions used by dccrg have to be
renamed to their MPI-1 versions.

Optionally dccrg can also use sfc++ which you can download
from https://gitorious.org/sfc/sfc/blobs/raw/master/sfc++.hpp
sfc++ is a C++ library for space-filling curves and
dccrg can use it for initializing the grid with better
initial cell partitioning than the default.
sfc++ is also a header only library so just place the
sfc++.hpp file somewhere where your compiler can find it.
To use sfc++ in dccrg define DCCRG_USE_SFC when compiling a
program using dccrg and sfc++ will be used to partition
the initial cells between processes using a Hilber
space-filling curve.
